This project was inspired by one of my favorite quotes from Jeff Bezos.
 
"All overnight success takes about 10 years" 
 
Having just recently left the start-up world to pursue a more niche career in Data Science, I wanted to analyze just how true his quote is.
 
More specifically, I wanted to look into how long it takes a company to go from birth to acquisition and how much money is made along the way.

 Turns out Jeff, was spot on. As long as you define success as $84 million dollars(on average). 
 
My dataset came from crunchbase snapshot and looked at ~5,000 companies that had been started and acquired prior to 2013.
 
While the median time between birth and acquisition falls just shy of 5 years, selling your company in the "early days" is going to cost you.
 
Companies that are founded and sold in less than 5 years have an avg sales price of $47 million dollars. 
 
While, if you can hold off a few more years and sell closer to 10 years old your avg sale price jumps up to $84 million. 
 
The lesson to be learned? Patience is key plus a lot of hard work and you too could grow a million dollar company.
