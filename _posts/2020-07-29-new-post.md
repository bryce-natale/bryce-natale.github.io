Hey Facebook Friends 👋🏻 
Over the years I’ve been against the cliche Facebook life updates so I’ve never posted one… until now.

In 2015 when I was just a sophomore in college Brent Henderson came to me and asked if I had an interest in doing social media for Zupp, his new vision for a downtown nightlife discovery app. Being passionate about both social media and nightlife I was immediately intrigued.
I had no idea the journey that would ensue over the next 5 years of launching and growing a mobile app in the college market, there were unknowns, no playbook, and ultimately a blank canvas where we got to create whatever we wanted.  

Fast forward to today and Zupp is the go-to platform in two college markets (UCF & FSU) for students going on adventures around campus with their friends, Zupp has over 10,000 paying members and is used by thousands of students every day when hanging out with friends.   

The opportunities Zupp has given me to grow as a person, a leader, a problem solver, an innovator are all qualities that I’ll be forever grateful for. I’ve learned more about patience, willingness to do the hard things, attention to detail, risk-taking than I ever could have imagined.   
After 5 years of eating, sleeping, and breathing Zupp, I’ve made the tough decision to begin the next chapter in my life. Where will this journey take me? I’m not exactly sure, but I do know that I wouldn’t trade the last 5 years for anything. 

When I think back over the years about everything I loved doing a few specifics come to mind, such as being creative, meeting new people, solving problems, and executing big ideas. And these are the same things that get me excited about my next adventure! 

While I acknowledge this might not be the best time to change careers I felt like it was the right decision for me and I’m confident that I’ll be able to bring all of my skills to a new role sooner than later.  
And to the team remaining at Zupp, I’m your biggest cheerleader now, shoot for the moon, enjoy what you get to do every day, your work is touching thousands of people, the Adventure Together Movement is stronger than ever! I can’t wait to see what you guys accomplish.
